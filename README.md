This code implements a simple quiz application in Python. Let's go through its capabilities:

1. User Input:
The code prompts the user to enter their first name, last name, and specialization.

2. Quiz Questions:
The code defines a set of quiz questions along with multiple-choice answers in a dictionary named QUESTIONS.

3. Quiz Generation:
Randomly selects a subset of questions (up to NUM_QUESTIONS_PER_QUIZ) for each quiz using random.sample().

4. Quiz Execution:
Loops through the selected quiz questions, presents each question along with shuffled answer choices, and collects the user's answers.
The user's grade is calculated based on the correctness of their answers, with a correct answer adding 0.5 points and an incorrect answer subtracting 0.75 points.

5. Quiz Statistics:
Keeps track of the number of correct and wrong answers.

6.Quiz Report File:
Generates a text document with the user's first name, last name, specialization, the number of correct and wrong answers, the overall grade, and a message indicating whether the exam is promoted or not.
The document is intended to be sent to the teacher.

7. File Handling:
Uses the with open() statement to handle file operations. It writes the user's information and quiz results to a text file.

8. User Feedback:
Provides feedback to the user after each question, indicating whether the answer is correct.

9. Randomization:
Randomly shuffles the answer choices for each question.

10. Input Validation:
Ensures that the user's answer is one of the valid choices.

11. Grade Calculation:
Calculates the user's overall grade based on the correctness of their answers.

12. Promotion Message:
Includes a congratulatory message if the overall grade is above a certain threshold, and an encouragement message otherwise.


Conclusion: Overall, this code serves as a basic interactive quiz application, allowing users to take a quiz, receive feedback, and generate a report for submission to a teacher.
